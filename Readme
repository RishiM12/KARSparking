As the population increased in the metropolitan cities, the usage of vehicles also increased. Finding a car parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush
hours, is difficult for drivers. In disciplinary parking may result in damage to the car. Thus, there is a need to provide sufficient parking spaces coupled with plenty of slots
to help the user park his car safely. Basically, a parking system is one of the most adopted and fastest-growing solutions of a smart city. Currently, most of the existing car 
parks do not have a systematic system. Most of them are manually managed and a little inefficient. The idea behind our Android Application- “KARS Parking” is to help the user for
online parking booking.
In this application, user can view various parking areas also he can select it to view whether parking slot is available or not. If the parking slot is available in parking then 
the user can book it for some specific time slot also, this system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. It also utilizes the open ground for parking with 
security. So, it will solve the parking and traffic problem.
