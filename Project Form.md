## Form 2

## User Interface Design
1) Ease of use 
We have kept the user interface easy to use on both apps. The menu is easy to find. The moment the user starts the app, the user can find the menu. In the KARS parking app, we implemented the menu using a Navigation drawer. In the KARS masters app, the menu is on the main layout as there were more items on the menu.

2) Simple and Natural dialog
The dialog boxes and UI items have been written in natural language so that the user doesn't get confused.

3) Design for the users and their tasks

In the case of KARS parking, the users are those who want to park cars. So our design is similar to most service providing apps. There is a login for users so the service providers can identify them. The main screen consists of selecting the parking location and a payment system.

## Upload a User Centered Design File. This is part of above question.(You are supposed to upload a single file, If you have multiple files then merge them into a single file and then upload.)

(Rishi's part)

## Potential User Feedback
Tarun Lunia(+91 90167 20465): (For KARS Parking) Very easy to use login and registration screen but the layout for registration screen can be improved.
(For KARS master) Nice layout. Just a little alignment is necessary and colorful icon for UI.

Ravi Singh(+91 98178 28695):(For both apps) It's a good idea to make an app for both customers as well as car owners. This app would help the car owner to track the record of the user in an effective manner. The interface is easy and simple which is good.

Shrey Aggarwal(+91 79839 98829): (For KARS Parking) If this idea is implemented then this would be amazing.
It would free the unnecessary traffic created due to cars standing on the road due to the lack of parking space. The user interface is clean and clutter-free but it lacks polish. 

Umar(+91 82475 76392): The idea is very good especially for our population-dense nation. I like the layout of the owner's app. Everything that the user wants is visible at once. Still, the UI needs more polish. I also like the design of the app for normal users.

Vivan Singh(+91 96028 83330): The app idea has potential if it is implemented properly. 
(For KARS Parking) I like how after login, the app directly opens the map. I don't like apps that waste my time, where I would have to go through multiple unnecessary menus.

(For KARS master) Navigating through the menu is very intuitive. The biggest strength of the menu is it is not intimidating to use even for first-time users.

## feasibility study/ Business Context of the idea/ Monetization/ Opportunity Analysis 
As we are developing a software-based application we will not be spending a large amount of money in the future also. Currently, we are in the developing stage of our project that is we don't have potential users, for now. So we don't have to spend money but when our application grows bigger and the number of users increases, there will be some nominal charges that we will have to pay. We would pay for the services like Google's database service i.e. firebase, Google Maps API. While publishing our application on Google play store we will have to pay some charges.

Our project focuses on the difficulty faced by vehicle owners while finding parking spaces and also the landowners who face difficulty managing the parking places. The thing that everyone knows but doesn't have the solution.
This project is unique because it will help vehicle owners find parking spaces which they will be able to book instantly and landowners to use their vacant land to earn money and also manage it easily.

After getting some potential users we will take a certain percentage of cut from the parking owners which will depend on their customer base, location, and other factors.

Nowadays online payments are becoming popular among people as they are handy to use and secure, we are planning to introduce UPI payments in our application. We are planning to make our application useful to a wide range of people, so to do so we will try to update our application from time to time with new features.  

## Project cost estimation
As we are in the developing stage of our semester project 'kars parking' which is only a software-based application, we do not have to spend money for now but when our application grows bigger and the number of users increases, there will be some nominal charges that the users will have to pay. The user would pay for the services like Google's database service i.e. firebase; we are using it for user's authentication and also for storing their data, Google Maps API for using google map in our application. While publishing our application on Google play store we will have to pay some charges.

## Week wise Updates/ Diary/ Proportional achievement of stated outcomes/ Graded Functionality etc 
Week 1(1/8/2020-7/8/2020)-
Firstly we formed  into a team of four (Archit, Rishi, Kaustubh and Shantanu).Then we decided to make an app as due 
to Covid, it was difficult for us to work on project related to hardware like drone and as we have a common 
interest in Android Application.But we were not sure about the idea to implement.So,we researched about it on 
different websites and came up with the idea of parking cars as it is similar to Bookmyshow.
 
Week 2 (8/8/2020-14/8/2020)-
We were agreed to work on the areas of android app that we were interested in more and divided work accordingly.
Archit took user's app,Rishi took parking owner's app,Shantanu goes with database of user's app and Kaustubh took 
back end of parking owner's app and GPS location of the parking place.We discussed the idea with Gaurav Singhal Sir 
in our first class of design and thinking ,and he liked the idea very much.

Week 3(15/8/2020-21/8/2020)-
We started working on first form of Design and Thinking project and slowed our speed on researching about project 
implementation as we were approaching towards the deadline of the same.We have learned new things about Android 
Studio and learned to implement them like working with GPS,storing real-time data in database,retrieving data and 
much more.We hope that we could complete our research on our specified areas by the next week. 

Week 4(22/8/2020-29/8/2020)-
We have completed our research on  the areas chosen by each member.We asked to our 4th year senior to  give his 
opinion and ideas to add different features .We are looking forward to start working on the app in the upcoming weeks.
Once again,we talked to Gaurav Sir about the project and how to start the work on the app.Hope we could make the 
layout of the app by the next week.

Week 5 (20/8/2020-6/9/2020)-

Firstly on Thursday(3/9/2020), we conducted a meeting on Zoom to plan the project execution , 
discussed ideas and about adding new features.Researched about storing current
location of parking owner , navigation window ,discussed about the layout of Login and Registration 
page and interface of parking owner's app with Gaurav Singhal Sir and to our seniors.

Week 6 (7/9/2020-13/9/2020)-
Successfully created login and registration page for user's app and connected the app to database using firebase.
Started working on navigation window and user's location.
Though ,We have not progressed much in parking owner's app just done with the layout of login page in 
android studio,due to some error in .gradle file,we are behind the schedule. 
Hope we can cover in forthcoming week. 

Week 7(14/9/2020-20/9/2020)-
Successfully added navigation window and location through GPS in user's app .
Started working on main layout of user's app.Successfully created layout  of parking owner's app ,
registration page and done with layout of user's app.Hope we can complete the layout of user's app , 
parking owner's app in next week and start working on firebase in the month of october.

Week 8(21/9/2020-27/9/2020)-
Created layout of parking owner's registration page ,login page in previous week and connected the app to firebase .
Different activity has also been created for parking owner's app.
As we are approaching to the deadline of form second ,we have slowed our speed of work.From next week,
we will start working on back end. Hope we can finish our project by the end of October.


## Week Wise Plan for the remaining time to complete the Project
Week 9(28/9/2020-4/10/2020)-

We are almost done with making the user's app and done with layout of the 
parking owner's app.From this week ,we will start working on back end,Kaustubh 
would work on parking owner's app database and Shantanu will work on user's app 
database.For the whole October, we would work on back end as it is the last part 
of our project.After that we would test our app,if there will be any flaws or error,
we would try to remove them.

Week 10(5/10/2020-11/10/2020)-

Shantanu will work on storing information of user in database through registration 
and login page. Kaustubh will work on storing information of parking owner in 
database through login and registration page.Hope we could start working on storing 
booking,payment ,save slot data of user's app and view user,view feedback,view 
payment of user's of parking owner's app.

Week 11(12/10/2020-18/10/2020)-
We would be done with storing information of user in database through registration 
and login page and  storing information of parking owner in database through login 
and registration page.By the next week,we would complete our app by connecting two 
apps through database so that our apps would work in real time and if we would get 
any error ,we would try to remove it and complete our project.

Week 12(19/10/2020-25/10/2020)-
We would be done with connecting the two apps,and would check if there is any error 
or flaw in our app.We would try to remove it and final check the working of the apps.
If there any feature to be added later,we find it important would add before the 
final showcase of the project in December.Otherwise ,the project would be completed 
by the end of October or the first week of December.

## Form 1

## Project Title
KARS Parking

## Describe your Project
As the population increased in the metropolitan cities, the usage of vehicles also increased. Finding a car parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. In disciplinary parking may result in damage to the car. Thus, there is a need to provide sufficient parking spaces coupled with plenty of slots to help the user park his car safely.
 Basically, a parking system is one of the most adopted and fastest-growing solutions of a smart city. Currently, most of the existing car parks do not have a systematic system. Most of them are manually managed and a little inefficient. The idea behind our Android Application- “KARS Parking” is to help the user for online parking booking.  
In this application, user can view various parking areas also he can select it to view whether parking slot is available or not. If the parking slot is available in parking then the user can book it for some specific time slot also, this system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. It also utilizes the open ground for parking with security. So, it will solve the parking and traffic problem.

## Why I have Chosen This Project? 
Do it yourself.

## What problem it solves?
Our KARS Parking application is mainly solving the issues related to parking of vehicles. As we all know that due to the huge population of cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, etc. there is a need for parking spaces in these cities. According to a survey in 2017-18 that was conducted in Delhi, there are 556 motor vahicles per one thousand people. This is a serious situation as space is finite but the no. of vehicles are increasing per year. Therefore, there is need for efficient parking plans which we are aiming for through our application.

## Who will be the potential clients/customers/users/startups/beneficiaries of the project. Describe appropriately. Why you think they are your target audience?
The lack of availability of parking spaces is faced by almost everyone living in urban and metropolitan areas. Our primary clients are the people who struggle to find a parking spot regularly. Other potential clients are corporate clients. With the lack of space and high building costs in cities, many small and medium-sized enterprises cannot afford to have or build parking spaces in their office building but using our app they can rent nearby parking lots for their employees. 
Providing parking spaces is not a popular business. It's very inconvenient for customers to find parking spaces in the complex network of cities therefore people hesitate to invest in this business. This app will help connect parking space owner to customers and grow their business.
Problem it Solves
We are making an application KARS Parking to Find a car parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours for drivers. We will provide sufficient parking spaces coupled with plenty of slots to help the user to park their car safely. we want To make user friendly, more efficient android application to solve the problem of overcrowding of vehicles in cities. 
it will help vehicle owners to find parking slots according to their relevant prizes and distances. here they will also be able to book their parking slots online
We are making one application for parking space owners also where they will be notified whenever there is a booking made and they will also be able to control the number of vehicles they want to allow.

## What will be the innovation in this project?
1) India has one of the biggest traffic problems and the major cause of this is the lack of convenient parking spaces. Most of the vehicles are parked on the road which causes congestion. Currently there is no convenient system for people to find parking space near their location. Our mobile app is going to provide a solution for this problem

2) Other major cause of inconvenience for people is the non availability of parking spaces when they are required due to vehicles already being parked especially for locations with continuous influx and efflux of people like Shopping malls, Cinema halls etc. Our app solves this problem by letting people book parking spots in advance for certain periods of time.

3)  India needs more parking spaces but who is going to provide them? Providing parking space is not a popular business avenue in our country which is the reason for the lack of parking spaces in the first place. One of the biggest reasons for that is there is no convenient way for customers to find such locations unless the parking owner spends ludicrous amounts of money in advertisement. Our app is not only going to solve the customer's problem but it will also solve the parking owner's problem. Using our app parking lot owners can list their parking lots on the app and customers parking nearby can use their services. It's a win-win situation for both consumers and service providers.

## How it will be different from similar existing solutions
1) Google Maps - After searching on the play store I found that nearest related existing solutions to our project is Google Maps, were it has one feature where we can find nearby parking spaces and also save parking location but for now it does not provide any feature for booking a parking slot and something that will help parking space owners to control their parking spots and get each and every necessary information about the car owners right. so here it is a huge gap that our project is going to fill.

2)Smart Community Parking: Sharing Parking locations - This application is community based, that is, it does not deal with paid parking spots. It uses the random spaces where there is no "NO PARKING" zones which are marked on the google maps. This application is an intermediate between two costumers. Our application finds a space owned by a specific person who gets paid for letting our costumer use his land for parking the costumer's vehicle.

3) Park+ Discover and book the best parking spots - this application is the closest of all three to our application. Our application will involve two parties, first, the costumer and second, the land owners. But the Park+ application is different from KARS Parking in this aspect, as they are only considering the costumer aspect.

## What makes it challenging enough to be chosen to be done in four months (Aug-Nov) 
Firstly,we are planning to make a hardware project but due to Covid we have to with app .As we all are
new to Android so it will take us a month to learn and understand it from scratch.Discussing the idea with teachers,
and friends ,their suggestions was time taking job.From creating login page to full working app,we have to  lot of challenges in adding features 
like gps,slot management etc.We have to make two apps ,one for the user and other for parking owner,so 
we have divided the task accordingly.As login and sign up page are common in both the apps,so it would give us some time to work on other parts of the app.Also the slot booking 
and to manage the records was challenging.We have to maintain  both project and academics simultaneously.
Secondly,it will take about three and a half months to complete the whole project .It is worth doing as we will get
some knowledge about android,how apps work,how their databases works.

## How you will measure the success/outcome/quality of your project 
We will add a feedback module to our application and according to the comments of the users, we plan to keep a check on the quality of the application. As far as the success of the project is concerned we can see the number of people who downloaded this application which in turn will help us to keep a check on the quality. We are also planning to upload the application on the Google Play Store, if we get a good rating then we will consider our project a success. We will try to add new features as often as we can and will also try to make the application the best version of itself.

## Resources required for the project and the feasibility of their availability as per the plans
On the software side of things this project requires the knowledge of Java, Android Studio,Room,Firebase,Google Maps. We will develop the basic UI and functionality of the app using Android Studio and Java. Google Maps API for android is required to find current location of the user and display nearby parking spots. For storing information such as login, user preferences etc. we will use Firebase and Room. As per our plans no funding will be required for test versions but for a proper release version funds will be required to rent services of both Google Maps API and Firebase. 

## If you are a team of 2 or more then clearly define responsibilities and how each member should be assessed differently
We are a group of four,so we have divided the work accordingly.Archit Joshi(E19CSE155) and Shantanu Bhardwaj(E19CSE180) both are working
on vehicle's owner app.While Archit will design app's interface and connecting app to gps system .Shantanu is tasked to link both the apps and to add
 , chatting feature, slot booking part. Kaustubh Joshi(E19CSE123) will be managing data.He will be working on creating database and storing ,retrieving the same. Rishi Mehta(E19CSE267) will be working on master's app.He will design master's app interface and to make a slot giving system to the user
through parking owner's app.

## Short and long term planning with detailed and logical steps and timelines. You may upload a Time Chart also
our Short term goal is to make an application for vehicle owners where we will be able to find parking places nearby or where we will be able to search for parking places and will be able to book slots. and one application for parking space owners where they will receive bookings and information about the vehicle owner, this application will also help them to manage their parking spots in a better way. here we want to complete our project in the allotted time of four months with full dedication.
our long term goal is to add calling and chatting feature through which vehicle owners and parking space owners will be able to interact and we will also try to introduce online UPI payments through which they will be provided with the option to pay on the go and will receive extra time form what they get when they choose to pay through cash if they are late by any chance. if we will be able to upload our application "KARS Parking" in the google play store successfully with positive reviews we will consider it as an award.

## Evidence/literature/research/survey etc. in support of the hypothesis or idea to be successful. (Local/National/International Context)
The demand for parking in Indian metros is seeing no signs of stopping. Because land resources are limited, it isn’t possible to conveniently plan parking spaces according to the demand. Instead of increasing available parking spaces, an effective technology-based solution must be employed to optimize the use of available spaces. Using the software, smart parking solutions can provide both parking operators and drivers with a real-time map of available spaces.
Apart from allowing drivers to reserve spots based on their convenience, smart parking apps also make mobile payments possible. Not only does this save drivers time spent searching for a spot, but it also reduces environmental degradation resulting from congestion caused by parking. Many smart cities in India are gradually taking to technology as part of a set of interventions to solve their parking woes, an encouraging development for mobility issues in urban areas.
As per a report, to find a suitable parking space, drivers in the US spend an average of 17 hours a year. And this hunt for parking space costs $345 per driver in terms of the time involved, fuel exhausted and emissions released. Just like 'Bookmyshow' has an important feature to book seats in cinema halls, our app will function somewhat similar, except it would be available for both car owner and parking owner other features like chatting box would be in this app. The lack of availability of parking spaces is faced by almost everyone living in urban and metropolitan areas. Our primary clients are the people who struggle to find a parking spot regularly. From the 21st century, there is a rapid advancement in technology so it has created jobs for people.

1. KARS Parking System is used to book parking slots without any great effort by the user using an android device. 
2.  The user can check the status of the parking area and book the parking slot in advance. This will result in overcoming many problems which are being created due to the bad management of the traffic. 
3. Mobile computing has proven as the best area of work for researchers in the areas of database and data management so this application is applied in Android Mobile OS. 
4. This application is utilized by can be applied nook and corner due to its easy usage and effectiveness.

## Risk Analysis (What are the factors which pose risk of failure of your project and risk of not completing your project by deadline) 
One of the major problem that any new app faces is its lack of popularity especially if it doesn't have a huge marketing fund. Since hundreds of new apps release everyday on app store it's difficult for any app to get noticed. 

Another major hurdle on an organisational level would be to have proper communication regarding the project and keep track of each member's progress as we will not be able to meet whenever we want due to the pandemic situation. We would have to plan meetings in advance and have to make them as efficient as possible.

Given the nature of software development it is natural to have bugs in the early versions of software. A nasty bug can cause crashes or unexpected behavior overall. Proper testing is necessary to ensure that such disasters do not happen.

## Give Names and emails of Three Persons with whom you have discussed the details of the project and what was their reaction/suggestion.
First,We discussed our project idea with our mentor Gaurav Singal(gaurav.singal@bennett.edu.in) sir. He appreciated our idea, told us that it has potential to be a great project and  suggested  to add some features that will make our project more presentable .
then, we shared our project details with an industrialist currently working at JUSPAY Naman Kalkhuria(naman.kalkhuria@juspay.in). his words on our project were "It's nice to know that students are comming up with these type of ideas, after seeing their prototype. I was really impressed, just stay dedicated and come up with the best you can."
  do the parent's reaction on your own

## List down the Ethics, Privacy, Moral and Legal issues related with the project 
while making our application we tried to keep our application "KARS Parking" away from all types of legal and copyright issues, we made everything on our own including our application icon, application name. for privacy policies also we made our own registration and login system so that data of our application users can not be misused. As per our plans, no funding will be required for test versions but for a proper release version funds will be required to rent services of both Google Maps API and Firebase. for using this application you will have to give location access to this application.
