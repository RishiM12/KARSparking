## Project Title
KARS Parking

## Describe your Project
As the population increased in the metropolitan cities, the usage of vehicles also increased. Finding a car parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours, is difficult for drivers. In disciplinary parking may result in damage to the car. Thus, there is a need to provide sufficient parking spaces coupled with plenty of slots to help the user park his car safely.
 Basically, a parking system is one of the most adopted and fastest-growing solutions of a smart city. Currently, most of the existing car parks do not have a systematic system. Most of them are manually managed and a little inefficient. The idea behind our Android Application- “KARS Parking” is to help the user for online parking booking.  
In this application, user can view various parking areas also he can select it to view whether parking slot is available or not. If the parking slot is available in parking then the user can book it for some specific time slot also, this system provides an additional feature of cancelling the bookings. It also utilizes the open ground for parking with security. So, it will solve the parking and traffic problem.

## What will be the innovation in this project?
1) India has one of the biggest traffic problems and the major cause of this is the lack of convenient parking spaces. Most of the vehicles are parked on the road which causes congestion. Currently there is no convenient system for people to find parking space near their location. Our mobile app is going to provide a solution for this problem

2) Other major cause of inconvenience for people is the non availability of parking spaces when they are required due to vehicles already being parked especially for locations with continuous influx and efflux of people like Shopping malls, Cinema halls etc. Our app solves this problem by letting people book parking spots in advance for certain periods of time.

3)  India needs more parking spaces but who is going to provide them? Providing parking space is not a popular business avenue in our country which is the reason for the lack of parking spaces in the first place. One of the biggest reasons for that is there is no convenient way for customers to find such locations unless the parking owner spends ludicrous amounts of money in advertisement. Our app is not only going to solve the customer's problem but it will also solve the parking owner's problem. Using our app parking lot owners can list their parking lots on the app and customers parking nearby can use their services. It's a win-win situation for both consumers and service providers.

## Who will be the potential clients/customers/users/startups/beneficiaries of the project. Describe appropriately. Why you think they are your target audience?
The lack of availability of parking spaces is faced by almost everyone living in urban and metropolitan areas. Our primary clients are the people who struggle to find a parking spot regularly. Other potential clients are corporate clients. With the lack of space and high building costs in cities, many small and medium-sized enterprises cannot afford to have or build parking spaces in their office building but using our app they can rent nearby parking lots for their employees. 
Providing parking spaces is not a popular business. It's very inconvenient for customers to find parking spaces in the complex network of cities therefore people hesitate to invest in this business. This app will help connect parking space owner to customers and grow their business.
Problem it Solves
We are making an application KARS Parking to Find a car parking space in most metropolitan areas, especially during the rush hours for drivers. We will provide sufficient parking spaces coupled with plenty of slots to help the user to park their car safely. we want To make user friendly, more efficient android application to solve the problem of overcrowding of vehicles in cities. 
it will help vehicle owners to find parking slots according to their relevant prizes and distances. here they will also be able to book their parking slots online
We are making one application for parking space owners also where they will be notified whenever there is a booking made and they will also be able to control the number of vehicles they want to allow.

## What problem it solves?
Our KARS Parking application is mainly solving the issues related to parking of vehicles. As we all know that due to the huge population of cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, etc. there is a need for parking spaces in these cities. According to a survey in 2017-18 that was conducted in Delhi, there are 556 motor vahicles per one thousand people. This is a serious situation as space is finite but the no. of vehicles are increasing per year. Therefore, there is need for efficient parking plans which we are aiming for through our application.
